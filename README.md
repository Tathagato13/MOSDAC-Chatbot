# MOSDAC-Chatbot
The repo contains the project about an AI power Chatbot for MOSDAC website of ISRO which contain all the structural and unistructural information about the website and return those as a conversional manner 



A Python-based chatbot project with web integration. This repository contains the core logic, web templates, and supporting scripts to run and extend the chatbot.

## 📂 Project Structure


Directories

artifacts/
Stores generated outputs such as embeddings, vector indexes, temporary model files, or intermediate artifacts created during ingestion and retrieval.

chatbot_logic/
Contains the core backend logic of the chatbot, including modules for scraping MOSDAC content, processing documents, chunking text, generating embeddings, retrieving relevant information, and assembling final answers.

data/
Holds all datasets and resource files — raw scraped HTML pages, cleaned text files, metadata JSONs, and any additional knowledge-base content.

files/
Used for uploads or downloads needed by the application (e.g., exported answers, uploaded datasets, test files).

logs/
Contains runtime logs for debugging and analysis, including scraper logs, ingestion logs, and application-level reports.

scripts/
Helper utility scripts for tasks like automated ingestion, batch testing, index rebuilding, maintenance jobs, or data cleaning.

static/
Frontend static assets, including CSS stylesheets, JavaScript files, images, icons, and other resources loaded by the UI.

templates/
HTML templates used for rendering the chatbot web interface or additional dashboard pages.

Files (Root Level)

main.py
Main entry point of the project. Handles initialization, server startup, ingestion triggers, and bridges the frontend with backend logic.

query_engine.py
Central module that orchestrates retrieval + LLM response generation. Builds prompts, composes context from retrieved chunks, and formats final answers with citations.

retriever.py
Handles all retrieval operations. Takes a query, embeds it, performs similarity search, applies optional reranking, and returns the most relevant text chunks.

vector_store.py
Manages embedding storage. Builds and loads the vector index, adds new documents, performs high-speed similarity search, and maintains persistent index files.

mosdac_scraper.py
Crawls and downloads MOSDAC website pages. Fetches raw HTML, cleans content, extracts structural elements, and saves them into the data directory with metadata.

chunker.py
Breaks cleaned text into smaller, meaningful chunks using character or token limits. Attaches metadata like source URL, headings, and text offsets for precise citations.

file_extractor.py
Extracts readable text from HTML/PDF files. Removes boilerplate, normalizes formatting, preserves key sections, and prepares content for chunking and embedding.

ask_question.py
A simple command-line interface to process a single query. Useful for quick tests and debugging the retrieval + generation pipeline.

ask_question_multi.py
Supports multiple queries in one session. Useful for batch testing, evaluating the system, or running continuous queries during development.

full_satellite_kg_with_faqs.json
A sample dataset containing satellite-related knowledge and FAQs. Acts as a predefined knowledge base for offline testing or demos.

content_metadata.json
Stores metadata generated during scraping and ingestion, including URLs, titles, hashes, timestamps, and content statistics.

scraper.log
Log file generated by the scraper. Records visited URLs, errors, extraction notes, and debugging information.

index.html
The main user interface. Provides the chat window where users type questions and view chatbot responses.

script.js
Implements frontend logic. Sends user queries to the backend API, handles JSON responses, and updates the UI dynamically.

style.css
Visual design and layout styling for the chatbot interface.

requirements.txt
Python dependency list required to set up the full backend environment.

.gitignore
Defines which files should not be tracked by Git (logs, cache files, indexes, temporary outputs, etc.).
